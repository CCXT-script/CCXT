### **2. Getting Started with CCXT**

#### **2.1 Installation 📦**
You can install CCXT easily through pip (for Python) or npm (for JavaScript). Here’s how to install CCXT for Python:

```bash
pip install ccxt
```

For JavaScript (Node.js):

```bash
npm install ccxt
```

After installing, you can import the library into your script to begin using its features.

#### **2.2 Connecting to an Exchange 🔑**
To connect to an exchange, you’ll need to provide your API keys (obtainable from the exchange’s developer settings). Once you have them, you can initialize the exchange instance like so:

```python
import ccxt

exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'apiKey': 'your_api_key',
    'secret': 'your_api_secret',
})
```

This establishes a connection to Binance (or any other supported exchange) using your API credentials.

#### **2.3 Fetching Market Data 📉**
You can retrieve various types of market data, such as order books, trading pairs, and historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data. For example, to get the latest order book for BTC/USDT on Binance:

```python
order_book = exchange.fetch_order_book('BTC/USDT')
print(order_book)
```

This returns real-time data on the buy and sell orders for the BTC/USDT pair.

#### **2.4 Placing Orders 🛍️**
To place an order, you can use the `create_market_order()` or `create_limit_order()` methods. Here's how to place a market order:

```python
order = exchange.create_market_buy_order('BTC/USDT', 0.01)
print(order)
```

This will buy 0.01 BTC using USDT at the current market price.

#### **2.5 Managing Account 📊**
To check your balance or retrieve information about your open orders, use the following methods:

```python
balance = exchange.fetch_balance()
print(balance)

open_orders = exchange.fetch_open_orders('BTC/USDT')
print(open_orders)
```

These commands allow you to track your account performance and active orders.
